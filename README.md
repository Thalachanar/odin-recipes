# odin-recipes
This project is an experiment for myself. I am going to be learning how to create a basic website using HTML and CSS, containing recipes. 
Through this, I hope to learn some of the more fundamental principles of HTML and CSS, as well as potentially Javascript for creating enhanced user functionality.
