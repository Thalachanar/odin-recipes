        <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
            <p>Sticky toffee pudding, also known as STP or as sticky date pudding in Australia and New Zealand, is a British dessert 
                consisting of a moist sponge cake, made with finely chopped dates, covered in a toffee sauce and often served with a 
                vanilla custard or vanilla ice-cream. It is considered a British classic by various culinary experts, although the 
                origins of the contemporary dish are only in the middle of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>These luscious sticky toffee puddings 
                are all about the honeyed sweetness of plump dates and creamy caramel. A touch of corn syrup ensures that the caramel 
                stays silky smooth, while a bit of vanilla in the cake complements its richness. Serve them with a dollop of unsweetened 
                whipped cream for contrast.</p>
        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
            <h4>Toffee Sauce</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces)</li>

                </ul>
            <h4>Cake</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 ounces pitted dates (about 7 dates preferably Medjool)</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup water</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspon baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter (softened)</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream (for serving)</li>
                </ul>
        <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, combine 1 1/4 cups of the cream with the butter, corn syrup and sugar; bring to a boil. 
                    Cook over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until a deep amber caramel forms, about 40 minutes. Carefully 
                    whisk in the remaining 1 1/4 cups of cream. Strain the sauce through a sieve into a bowl.</li>
        </br>
                <li>In a small saucepan, simmer the dates in the water over moderately low heat until the water is nearly absorbed and 
                    the dates are soft, about 15 minutes. Transfer the dates and any liquid to a food processor and puree until very smooth.</li>
        </br>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Lightly butter six 1/2-cup ramekins. In a small bowl, whisk the flour with the baking 
                    powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter with the brown sugar at 
                    medium speed until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla, then beat in the date puree. At low speed, beat 
                    in the dry ingredients. Spoon the batter into the ramekins and smooth the tops. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a 
                    toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean; let cool slightly.</li>
        </br>
                <li>Using a small serrated knife, trim the tops of the cakes level with the rims of the ramekins. Unmold the cakes and 
                    invert them onto a wire rack. Slice each cake in half horizontally. Wipe out the ramekins and spoon 1 tablespoon of 
                    the toffee sauce into each. Return the bottom layers of the cakes to the ramekins, cut side up. Spoon another 
                    tablespoon of the toffee sauce into the ramekins and top with the remaining cake layers. Spoon another tablespoon 
                    of the toffee sauce over the cakes and spread evenly. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, 
                    or until the toffee is bubbling around the edges.</li>
        </br>
                <li>Let the puddings cool for 5 minutes, then run a thin-bladed knife around the insides of the ramekins; invert each 
                    pudding onto a dessert plate. Rewarm the remaining toffee sauce and spoon some around the puddings. Serve with vanilla 
                    ice cream or whipped cream.</li>
            </ol>
